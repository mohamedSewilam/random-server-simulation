Inputs:
Implement interarrival and service time in two ways:
• Using exact numbers given in the slides (for testing the correctness of your
simulation). Do this for the exercise solved in the section.
• Randomly generated numbers using a random number generator (based on the
probability distributions described in the slides). Do this for 100 customers (rows).
o Interarrival times: Uniform between 0 and 1.
o Service times: Uniform between 0 and 1.

Outputs:
• The simulation table.
• Show the following statistics:
o Average time a customer spends in the queue (waiting time in queue).
o Probability of waiting.
o Probability of the server being idle.
o Average service time.
o Average Interarrival time (time between arrivals).
o Average time a customer spends in the system.
o Average queue length.
o Server utilization.
o Average waiting time for those who wait.
